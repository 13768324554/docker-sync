  "body": "Developing with docker under OSX is a huge pain, since sharing code into docker containers make the code-execution about 50 times slower (depends on the solution). Testing and working with a lot of the [alternatives](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker_sync/wiki/Alternatives-to-docker-sync) made me pick the best of those, and combine this in one single tool: docker-sync\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/docker-sync.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/docker-sync)\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install docker-sync\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocker-sync is:\r\n - able to run on all of those docker-machines and also on **docker for mac**\r\n - it uses either **rsync** or **unison** to sync. The container performance is not influenced at all, see [performance](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker_sync/wiki/4.-Performance)\r\n - efficient in its way to watch for file changes - even for 12k+ files it will not eat up you CPU\r\n - supports either one-way sync ( rsync ) or two way sync ( unison )\r\n - **supports user-remapping on sync to avoid permission problems on the container**\r\n\r\nBesides performance being the first priority for docker-sync, the second is, not forcing you into using a **specific** docker solution. Use docker-for-mac, docker toolbox, VirtualBox, VMware Fusion or Parallels, xhyve or whatever!\r\n\r\n## Documentation, Installation, Configuration\r\n\r\nAll the information is provided [in the Wiki](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker_sync/wiki)",
